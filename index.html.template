This document describes a common data model for the <a>Web of Things</a>. The W3C Web of Things Thing Description provides a narrow-waist set of vocabulary for describing physical and/or virtual Things in a machine readable format with a default JSON-LD encoding. A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally due to Thing's resource restrictions (e.g. limited memory space) or when a Web of Thing-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.

<!-- for devices.
The TD must be acquired to use and interact with the Thing, since it describes the semantics of a Thing as well as its <a>WoT Interface</a>. Usually, Things directly provide their own TD, but the TD can also be hosted externally if there is not enough space on the device or when a WoT-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a TD.-->

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
The W3C Thing Desccription (TD) is a central building block in a Web of Things (WoT) enabled system and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing (aka the <i>index.html</i> of the Thing). The TD comprises of semantic metadata for the Thing itself, a narrow-waist interaction model with WoT's Properties, Actions, and Events, a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
</p>
<p>
Properties can be used for controlling parameters, such as a set point or operation state. Actions model invocation of physical processes, but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. Events cover the push model where state change notifications, discrete events, and streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver. In general, the TD provides metadata for the different communication bindings (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, (MQTT?), etc.), mediaTypes (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor", "application/exi" etc.), and security policies (authentication, authorization, etc.). The default serialisation of the TD is JSON-LD.
</p>

<p>
Example 1 shows a simple TD that describes a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
</p>

    <h1>Namespaces</h1>

<p>
The namespace for TD is http://www.w3.org/ns/td#. TD itself defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own. A full set of namespaces and prefixes used in this document is shown in the table below.

How to validate TD? RDF validation? Structure validation?

  <section>
    <h1>Serialization</h1>

      <p class="ednote">Currently, JSON-LD is seen as baseline for TD serialization. In TD task force alternatives are validated.
      </p>

  <section>
    <h2>JSON-LD</h2>
<p>
  <a>JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that adds a semantic layer on top of the JSON specification: the terms that appear in a JSON document
  should be associated with uniquely identified concepts from shared vocabularies. This principle is part of a set of practices to publish data
  on the Web called Linked Data, where concepts are usually identified with URIs and originate from RDF vocabularies.
</p>
   </section>
 
    <section>
      <h2><code>@context</code></h2>



<p>
  The association between terms and concept URIs has to be declared in preamble of the JSON document with the keyword <code>@context</code>.
  The expected value for <code>@context</code> can be of different kinds. A first option is to use a JSON object where keys are terms and
  values are concepts URIs, e.g.:
</p>

  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": {
        "name": "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-ontology.owl#name",
        "base": "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-ontology.owl#associatedUri",
        "unit": "http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/qu/qu-rec20#unit",
        "Thing": "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-ontology.owl#Thing",
        ...
      }
    }
  </pre>

<p>
  It is also possible to declare namespaces in the context instead of terms. In the example above, three of the four URIs have the same prefix:
  <code>http://www.w3c.org/wot/td#</code>. This common part could be given a short name, refered to as a namespace (as in XML). URIs could
  then be shortened by concatenating namespace with <code>:</code> and a local name (anywhere in the JSON-LD document). E.g.:
</p>

  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": {
        "wot": "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-ontology.owl#",
        "name": "wot:name",
        "base": "wot:associatedUri",
        "unit": "http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/qu/qu-rec20#unit",
        "Thing": "wot:Thing",
        ...
      }
    }
  </pre>


<p>
  For the sake of reusability, it is also possible to define an external JSON-LD context and simply give its URI as value of <code>@context</code>.
  All JSON terms that are defined in the present document have been put in an external document, available at
  <code>http://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld</code>. It is highly recommended (but not mandatory) to include this standard
  context in a Thing Description. A basic Thing Description would contain the following declaration:
</p>

  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": "http://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld",
      ...
    }
  </pre>

<p>
  A third option is to declare an array, in case a single document involves several contexts. Array elements are either objects or strings,
  as explained above. This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing TD context without modifying it. For instance:
</p>
  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["http://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld",
                   {"sensor": "http://example.org/sensors#"}],
      ...
    }
  </pre>

<p>
  Section <a href="#td-context-extension"></a> provides a more concrete example on that topic.
</p>
    </section>

    <section>
<h2>Security</h2>

<pre class="example">
  {
    ...
    "security": {"cat":"token:jwt", "alg":"HS256", "as":"https://authority-issuing.org"},
    ...
  }
</pre>

The <b>(optional)</b> security field can be used to provide access metadata (self-contained) information of the Thing
for securely transmitting information via all its resources. Also see Section <a href="#security-considerations">$TBD$</a>.


<p>Here as a example, JSON Web Token (JWT) type is assigned (cat), the corresponding hashing algorithm "HS256" (alg), and
issuing authority of the security token (as).</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Thing Metadata</h2>

      <p>A TD will provide some generic metadata vocabularies that can be used, e.g., 
      to assign a name or what kind of base URI does a servient support.</p>
      <pre class="example">
        {
          ...
          "name": "MyLED",
          "base": "coap://myled.example.com:5683/"
          ...
        }
      </pre>


      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Besides these pre-defined terms in the TD context, additional characteristics can be
        added such as product ID, firmware version, location, etc. These terms should then appear in the context of the Thing (as detailed in <a href="#td-context"></a>).
      </p>

    </section>
 

  <section>
    <h1>Interaction Patterns</h1>

    <p>
      An interaction in the context of the Web of Things is an exchange of data between a Web client and a Thing.
      This data can be either given as input by the client, returned as output by the Thing or both.
      Three interaction patterns have been defined so far: Property, Action and Event.
    </p>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Property</h3>
  
      <p>
        Property provides readable and/or writeable data that can be static (e.g., supported mode, rated output voltage, etc.) or 
        dynamic (e.g., current fill level of water, minimum recorded temperature, etc.).
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        {
          ...
          "interaction": [
            {
              "@type": ["Property"],
              "name": "temperature",
              "outputData":{ "type": "number" },
              "writable": false,
              "link": [{
                "href" : "coap://mytemp.example.com:5683/temp",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
              }],
              <i>"stability": 10</i>
            },
          ...
        }
      </pre>

    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Action</h3>
  
      <p>
        The Action interaction pattern targets changes or processes on a Thing that take a certain time to complete (i.e., actions cannot be applied instantaneously like property writes).
        Examples include an LED fade in, moving a robot, brewing a cup of coffee, etc.
        Usually, ongoing Actions are modelled as Task resources, which are created when an Action invocation is received by the Thing.
      </p>
  
      <pre class="example">
        {
          ...
          "interaction": [
            {
              "@type": ["Action", "actuator:fadeIn"],
              "name": "fadeIn",
              <i>"inputData":</i> { "type": "integer" },
              "link": [{
              	"href" : "coap://mytemp.example.com:5683/in",
              	"mediaType": "application/json"
              }]
            }
          ]
          ...
        }
      </pre>

    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h3>Event</h3>
  
      <p>
        The <code>Event</code> interaction pattern enables a mechanism to be notified by a Thing on a certain condition.
        While some protocols such as CoAP can provide such a mechanism natively, others do not.
        Furthermore, Events might need a specific configuration that requires data sent and stored on the Thing in a standard way.
        There are are two mandatory and two optional terms defined within the <code>Event</code> pattern:
      </p>
  
      <pre class="example">

        {
          ...
          "interaction": [
            {
              "@type": ["Event", "actuator:alert"],
              "name": "criticalCondition",
              "outputData":  { "type": "string" },
              "link": [{
              	"href" : "coap://mytemp.example.com:5683/ev",
              	"mediaType": "application/json"
              }]
            }
          ]
          ...
        }
      </pre>

    </section>




  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Type System</h1>

    <p>All of the three interaction types <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code> can specify the type of the value acceptable as an input or expected as an output of the interaction. JSON schema [[!draft-zyp-json-schema-04]] [[!draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00]] provides a standard way to describe the structure and datatypes of data, and we use JSON schema as the notation for value types of the interaction types.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> In the embodiment of type system described in this section, JSON schema is used as an abstract description system for structured data. 
      JSON schema is something that is already out there being used and well-known, therefore gives us a chance to get started quickly to experiment with type system idea for further contemplation. 
      Through discussion, the following points have been noted as feedback for improvements.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>JSON schema specification was designed for JSON, therefore, may not be an optimal solution as an encoding-neutral description system.</li>
        <li>JSON schema does not provide a way to associate data elements with citations or semantic concepts defined elsewhere.</li>
        <li>JSON schema is relatively verbose.</li>
        <li>JSON schema is not a formal standard.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the current plan is to use JSON-LD syntax to express the function of at least part of what JSON schema provides. This will enable Type System to allow the association of semantics while it remains compatible with JSON schema.
    </p>

    <p>For <code>Property</code> and <code>Event</code> interaction types, each property or event can specify its value type using <code>outputData</code> with JSON schema definition as its content. In the following example, <code>temperature</code> property and <code>criticalCondition</code> event are defined as  <code>number</code> and <code>string</code>, respectively.
    </p>

    <pre class="example">
      {
        ...
        "properties": [
          {
            ...
            "name": "temperature",
            "outputData": { "type": "number" },
            ...
          }
        ]
        ...
        "events": [
          {
            ...
            "name": "criticalCondition",
            "outputData": { "type": "string" },
            ...
          }
        ]
        ...
      }
    </pre>

    <p>Similarly, for <code>Action</code> interaction type, each action can specify its input and/or output value type with JSON schema definition as its content. The following is an example value type definition for an action. In the example, <code>fadeIn</code> action is defined to have <code>inputData</code> of type <code>number</code> and <code>outputData</code> of type <code>boolean</code>.
    </p>

    <pre class="example">
      {
        ...
        "actions": [
          {
            ...
            "name": "fadeIn",
            "inputData": {
              "valueType": { "type": "number" },
              "actuator:unit": "actuator:ms"
            },
            "outputData": {
              "valueType": { "type": "boolean" },
            },
            ...
          }
        ]
        ...
      }
    </pre>

    <section>
      <h4>Simple Data</h4>
      <p>With value types described by means of JSON schema, serialization of data exchanged between servients is straightforward when it is in JSON format. JSON Schema allows the following definitions in the <code>type</code> field:
        <ul>
          <li>boolean</li>
          <li>integer</li>
          <li>number</li>
          <li>string</li>
          <li>array</li>
          <li>object</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
	
      <p>Consider the following <code>inputData</code> definition which defines the value to be an <code>integer</code> within the value range of [ 0 ... 255 ].
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        "inputData": { 
          "type": "integer",
          "minimum": 0,
          "maximum": 255,
        }
      </pre>

      <p>When the <code>integer</code> being exchanged is 123, data serialization in JSON format will look like the following:
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        123
      </pre>

      <p>The snippet in the above example is a valid JSON document according to the syntax defined in [[!RFC7159]], which allows sending simple types in the root of the document. There is no need for wrapping a single value into an object.
      </p>

      <p>The same data (i.e. a number of 123) will look like the following when the data is exchanged in XML.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
      		&lt;integer>123&lt;/integer>
      </pre>

    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h4>Structured Data</h4>
  
      <p>In the previous section, we used an example <code>inputData</code> definition consisting of a single <code>integer</code>.
      </p>
	
      <p>Since we are using JSON schema to describe <code>inputData</code>, it is also possible to define value types that have more than one literal value.
      JSON provides two distinct constructs to define a structure that can have multiple literal values. 
      One is JSON object, and the other is JSON array.
      </p>

      <section>

    <h4>Mapping to XML Schema</h4>

      <p>In the previous section, examples showed what those data whose value type are described using JSON schema
      look like when serialized to XML in parallel to corresponding JSON serializations.
      </p>

      <p>This section describes how JSON schema definitions can be mapped to XML schema definitions by using the same examples.
      Given JSON schema definitions, providing the mapping to XML schema allows XML tools to directly validate serialized XML data, for example.
      </p>

      <p>The XML structure is based on EXI4JSON [[!exi-for-json]].
      The structure works uniformly well for both schema-less and schema-informed use cases. 
      </p>

      <p class="ednote">A complete "JSON Schema" to "XML Schema" mapping needs to be defined. 
      </p>

    <section>
      <h5>JSON Object Definition to XML Schema</h5>

      <p>Shown below is the JSON schema <code>object</code> definition used as the <code>inputData</code> in Section <a href="#json-object">JSON Object</a>. The <code>object</code> consists of two named literals <code>id</code> (of type <code>integer</code>) and <code>name</code> (of type <code>string</code>) where <code>id</code> is required to be present.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "id": {
                    "type": "integer"
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string"

            },
            "required": ["id"]
        }
      </pre>

      <p>When the <code>object</code> is anonymous (i.e. it is the root, or participates in an <code>array</code> definition), 
      the above <code>object</code> definition transforms to the following XML Schema element definition.
      </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      In the following, we give three examples of a full TD. The first one, a
      temperature sensor, shows how to define relations between Thing
      Properties. As a second example, we modeled
      an actuator (LED lamp) where Actions have all been characterized semantically,
      so that machines could unambiguously interpret them in an automated manner.
      At last, association between Things is shown by defining a master switch
      controlling other LED lamps.

      <p>
        The Thing <code>myTempSensor</code> defines two Properties: <code>myTemp</code>
        and <code>myThreshold</code>. Both are defined as temperatures, with the same unit
        (<code>celsius</code>). A client that is able to parse a TD only needs to know
        the predicate <code>reference</code> to understand that the threshold acts as
        a reference value for <code>myTemp</code> while the latter is the actual
        value measured by the temperature sensor. Here, <code>reference</code> points
        to <code>http://schema.org/valueReference</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, one of the Events of the Thing is linked to the measured value
        (with the predicate <code>property</code>). It means
        in that context that an event should be triggered each time <code>myTemp</code>
        changes. The other Event does not define further semantics, it could be used either
        in a closed system (where clients are aware of its meaning) or by a human but
        an external agent would not have sufficient information to interpret it.

      <p>
        In this last example, we illustrate the use of <code>associations</code>.
        The Thing we modeled here acts as a master switch for eight lamps similar
        to that of <a href="#led-actuator"></a>. It means switching on and off
        <code>myMasterOnOff</code> will propagate to all associated Things
        by toggling their Action that is also of type <code>Toggle</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        No precise semantics for <code>associations</code> have been defined yet
        and there might exist many other kinds of dependency between Things than
        simply parent/child relation. This issue will be addressed soon. Until then,
        Thing associations could be useful for discovery.
