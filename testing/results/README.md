= Implementation Results =
Raw data for implementations.  Each implementation should record
which features they have implemented and tested here.  All data will
be read and merged into the report.  Mark each implemented
feature with a 1.  These will be summed for the final report.
If you want to mention a feature but have not implemented it
record it with a zero.  If you have tested a feature in multiple
implementations either check in additional files (use a convention
like corporation-implementation.csv for the filename) or use
numbers greater than 1 to indicate multiple implementations.

The template.csv file lists all features but with implementation
counts of 0.  Do not edit this; it is autogenerated.  However,
you can use it as a basis for your own data files.

To Do: track tests of features that require two implementations to 
interact.  Probably need to add a column that tracks the other 
implementation's name (as given by the root name of these files).

Files should be in CSV format,
and will be parsed by the csvtojson Node.js library.
